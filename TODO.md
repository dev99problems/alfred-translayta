# TODO for Alfred-translayta

### NeXT

- `[X]` migrate to `pnpm`?
- `[X]` bump all deps versions to the latest minor/patch versions
- `[X]` convert all dependencies to strict version


## Backlog

#### General

- `[ ]` review all `NOTE` and `TODO` and convert them to TODO
- `[ ]` check the list of `shipped files`, npm package became a bit bloated
- `[ ]` migrate to `alfy@1.0.0` - the current one is `0.11.1`. Looks like this will require migration to `ESM`
- `[ ]` update `alfy-test` and add more coverage?!

----------------------------

#### Chore

- `[ ]` migrate to `main` branch + update CI


### Done

- `[X]` regerate favorites.json with `ukrainian` translations
- `[X]` clean-up the show-settings.js ⤵️
- `[X]` finish `Settings -> Favs exports` command
- `[X]` add `cache` support for CI, update actions versions
