# TODO
`[X]` regerate favorites.json with `ukrainian` translations
`[X]` clean-up the show-settings.js ⤵️
`[X]` finish `Settings -> Favs exports` command
`[ ]` add `cache` support for CI, update actions versions
`[ ]` check the list of `shipped files`, npm package became a bit bloated
`[ ]` migrate to `alfy@1.0.0` - the current one is `0.11.1`. Looks like this will require migration to `ESM`
`[ ]` migrate to `pnpm`?
